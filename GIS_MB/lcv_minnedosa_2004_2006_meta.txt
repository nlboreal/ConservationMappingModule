	Description:
		Abstract:
			This dataset contains coverage of various
			size, depicting land use / land cover features, which were
			compiled based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)
			imagery. The pixel resolution of this data is 30 meters.
			Upon classification, sixteen land classes are mapped,
			these being agricultural crop land, forage crops, grassland,
			open deciduous, deciduous, coniferous, mixedwood
			forests,treed rock, bogs, marshes and fens, bare rock,
			burnt areas, forest cutovers, open water, cultural features,
			roads and trails.
		Purpose:
			To display land use / land cover features used by earth
			resources management agencies and for environmental
			monitoring.

			Land Use/Land Cover Mapping of Manitoba
			1. Agricultural Cropland; All lands dedicated to the
			production of annual cereal, oil seed and other speciality
			crops. This class can be further sub-divided into three crop
			0% - 33%, 34% - 66%, and 67% - 100%.
			2. Deciduous Forest;75% - 100% of the forest canopy is
			deciduous. Dominant species include trembling aspen
			(Populus tremuloides), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera),
			and white birch (Betula papyrifera). May include small
			patches of grassland, marsh or fens less than two
			hectares in size.
			3. Water Bodies; All open water - lakes, rivers, streams,
			ponds and lagoons.
			4. Grassland/Rangeland; Mixed native and/or tame prairie
			grasses and herbs. May also include scattered stands of
			willow (Salix L.), choke cherry (Prunus virginiana), pin
			cherry (Prunus pensylvanica) and saskatoon (Amelanchier
			alnifolia). Many of these areas are used for cutting of hay
			and grazing. Both upland and lowland meadows fall into
			this class. There is normally less than 10% shrub or tree
			cover.
			5. Mixedwood Forest; 25% - 75% of the canopy is
			coniferous. May include patches of treed bog, marsh or
			fens less than two hectares in size.
			6. Marsh and Fens; Wet areas with standing or slowly
			moving water. Vegetation consists of grasses and/or
			sedge. Marshes will include common hydrophytic
			vegetation such as cattail and rushes. Fens will be formed
			on minerotrophic sites. Areas are frequently interspersed
			with channels or pools of open water.
			7. Treed and Open Bogs; Peat covered or peat filled
			depressions with a high water table. The bogs are covered
			with a carpet of Spagnum spp. and ericaceous shrubs and
			may be treeless or treed with black spruce (Picea mariana)
			and/or tamarack (Larix laricina).
			8. Treed Rock; Exposed bedrock with less than 50% tree
			cover.
			9. Coniferous Forest;  75% - 100% of the canopy are
			coniferous. Pine (Pinus spp.) and spruce (Picea spp.) are
			dominant species. May include patches of treed bog,
			marsh or fens less than two hectares in size.
			10. Burnt Areas; Burned forested areas with sporadic
			regeneration and can include patches of unburnt trees.
			11. Open Deciduous; Lands characterized by rough
			topography, shallow soil, or poor drainage. Supports a
			growth of shrubs such as willow (Salix spp.), alder (Alnus
			spp.) saskatoon (Amalanchier spp.) and/or stunted
			deciduous (Populus spp.) tree cover. An area could have
			up to 50% scattered tree or shrub cover.
			12. Forage Crops; Consists of perennial forage such as
			alflafa, and clover or blends of these with tame species of
			grass. Fall seeded crops such as winter wheat or fall rye
			are included here.
			13. Cultural Features; Built-up areas such as cities and
			towns, peat farms, golf courses, cemeteries, shopping
			centres, large recreation sites, auto wreck yards, airports,
			cottage areas, race tracks.
			14. Forest Cutover; Areas where commercial logging
			operations have clearcut or partially removed a standing
			forest. Includes areas which have been recently replanted.
			15. Bare Rock, Gravel and Sand; Exposed areas of
			bedrock, sand dunes, and beaches, gravel quarry/pit
			operations, mine tailings, borrow pits, and rock quarries.
			16. Roads and Trails; All highways, secondary roads, trails,
			cut survey lines, right-of-ways, railway lines and
			transmission lines.
